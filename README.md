ShadowNET is an interface/environment for group pen-testing in real time. It can be used by groups of white-hats for real-time pentesting in one single server, it can also be used to host a server for zombie devices and perform attacks.

More can be seen in the **Under development Documentation**

## What's coming in the next releases?

- ShadowNET's Probe: Remote connection to an infected device via backdoor (yes, performing console commands will be possible).
- ShadowNET's Zombie: Zombie network for infected devices.

## Why did i created ShadowNET?

I was in need of a multi-socket network server but i wasn't going to buy one and configure it from scratch. So i made a multi-socket network server from scratch.

ShadowNET is not only a server, it's also a whole framework based on custom commands and a unique structure for connection, and it will grow even more. Stay tuned.
